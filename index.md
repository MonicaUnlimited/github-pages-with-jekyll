### Enjoy the random Khaled Ipsum paragraphs
        
Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion! The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, [life is beautiful](yahoo.com), life is what you make it. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile.       
                        
You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. Don’t ever play yourself. The key to more success is to get a massage once a week, very important, major key, cloth talk. Don’t ever play yourself. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion!
